# temp-draw
temporary repo for the janky GL drawing code and other related stuff.

you'll find:

gldrawing - is the only open gl drawing code I have that I know runs at the moment, 
all it does currently is render a predefined touch path using opengl es and triangle 
strips. this is the basics of making open gl drawing work

gltesting - is a test I did that you can see about how to animate/translate objects
drawn using gl

good drawing algorith... - is the best/simplests/fastest algorithm for converting 
touches into accurate lines. this code snippet use the core graphics drawing which makes
it easier to read and understand.
